# Welcome to Carpenter!

As the lockdown continues I've been having more time on my hands. I know my fair share of Discord.js so I decided to start a small open-source bot project using the (now deprecated) Klasa framework. I intend to update this without a schedule, and this won't be an amazing bot, but anyways that's how I ended up here.
