# Setting up Carpenter

To use this bot in your server, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone this repo

- Navigate to the download button in the main repo.
- Click on **"Download ZIP"**. GitHub will download the repository to your downloads folder.
- Open the zip file and extract the **/src/** folder. You don't need anything else.

### 2. Setup the bot

Once you're in your chosen editor with the src folder opened, follow these steps.

- Create a file in the root and name it **.env**. Inside this file, write the following: 
```
token = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
```
(If you haven't got a bot yet, create an application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).)
